                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>My name is Kobi!</p>
                <br />
                <p>I am currently a student at Mt. Hood Community College, pursuing a degree in Computer Game Development.
                    I really enjoy city builders, rougelikes (AND rougelites), as well as real-time strategy games and first-person shooters. Pretty much anything that has randomness or management elements. I love crafting worlds and creating immersive universes for people to explore.</p>
                <h3>Where are you?</h3>
                <p>Well, my super spectacular portfolio, of course! Here you'll find information about projects I've worked on in the past and ones I am working on in the present.
                    If you're interested in what I am able to do for you, I have a contact form, as well as my contact information, on here! 
                    Don't hesitate to reach out if you think I am a good fit for something you need done. If you're interested in my socials, they are on there too.

                            designing a website and coding using basic HTML5 and CSS3 in about 3 months.</p><p> We were free to choose a subject, so I chose my band at 
                            the time. We were given a list of required features for the website with new ones added every week, 
                            and iterated on it over the course of 3 months. I produced three prior versions, and this one was the final product.</p></div>
